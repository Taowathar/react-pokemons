A React front-end application using Pokemon API for fulfilling Codecool Hungary full-stack course, advanced module, first self instructed week's task.

Deployed it to Netlify: https://infallible-cori-0692ba.netlify.app/
# üìí Tasks

My task was to create a React application for Pokemon API. It should have 3 available routes for listing pokemons, listing types and a detailed view for specific Pokemons.

1.

- Create a Navbar component
  it should contain Links to 2 routes: Pokemons and Types
- Create a PokemonList component. It's a simple component for listing every item on this endpoint
  it's available via the Pokemons link in the Navbar on http://localhost:3000/pokemons
- Create a TypeList component. It's a simple component for listing every item on this endpoint
  it's available via the Types link in the Navbar on http://localhost:3000/types
- Create a PokemonDetail component. It's a detailed page about a Pokemon's attributes, for example Bulbasaur
  these Links are available on the Pokemons page. Every listed Pokemon item should be a Link pointing to detailed pages, like http://localhost:3000/pokemon/1

2. Rewrite all components to Functional Components with Hooks.

3. Add some styling (and even multiple theme options) to the app.

4. Add a Theme switcher button to Navbar or implement a Gotta Catch 'Em All ...

5. Deploy the Reactomon App on Netlify
